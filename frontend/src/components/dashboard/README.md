# Dashboard Enhancements

This document describes the enhancements made to the dashboard to provide role-specific views for admin and manager roles.

## Overview

The dashboard has been enhanced to provide tailored experiences for different user roles:
- **Admins** get a comprehensive view of the entire system with employee management, project oversight, payroll analytics, and task tracking.
- **Managers** get tools to track team performance, manage tasks, oversee projects, and handle approvals.
- **Team Members** continue to see their personalized dashboard with work hours, performance metrics, and salary information.
