## Workflow Flow

1. **Employee Registration**:
   - User accesses `/employee-signup` through login page link
   - Completes multi-step registration form
   - Reviews and accepts terms & conditions
   - Submits registration for approval

2. **Admin/Manager Review**:
   - Admin/Manager accesses `/employee-approvals`
   - Reviews pending registrations
   - Approves or rejects applications

3. **Profile Completion**:
   - Approved employees complete profile at `/profile-creation`
   - Admins/Managers can add employees directly through Employee Management

## Role-Based Access

|------|-------------|--------------|
| Admin | Full Access | Create employees, approve registrations, manage all profiles |
| Manager | Limited Access | Create employees, approve registrations, manage team profiles |
| Team Member | Restricted Access | View own profile only |
